# so in this problem they are asking to find the sum of lengths of all the subarrays in an Array, if the maximum value
# in that subarray lies between the given range of values.



# suppose they give an range as 3 to 9
# Then we need to put this in set (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
# Hence we need to figure out how to qualify each of the subarrays
